# NodeJS Setups

This repo just houses some NodeJS setups that I've created, helping me get up and running
quickly when creating new projects. I like to create fun playgrounds to try out new pieces of code,
libraries etc, or just new setups in general, so having a repo like this saves me a lot
of time!
